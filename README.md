# Employee_Data_Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies employees with a high likelihood of promotion. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, we aim to create a tool that not only enhances the efficiency of the promotion process but also ensures fairness and transparency with EDA.
